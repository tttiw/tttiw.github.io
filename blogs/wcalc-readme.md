## Getting Started

wCalc works half like a REPL.
You write code in the editor, execute it, then continue building on top of your previous code.

You can customize the startup script with:

```python
wCalc.set_startup_script("""
# your script here
""")
```

For more functions that wCalc provides, check out the [wCalc API reference](@blogs/wcalc-api.md).

## Built With:

- Tauri 2.0
- Pyodide
- My time
- My energy

## Why I Built This

I wanted a convenient and satisfying tool that could take advantage of powerful Python libraries
(like `sympy` and `Pillow`) without needing to install packages on my machine, save scripts, or open a full-blown IDE.

So I built wCalc for myself, and now for you too. Hope you enjoy it!
