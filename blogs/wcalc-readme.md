## Getting Started

wCalc works like a hybrid between an interpreter and a REPL. 
You write code in the editor, execute it, then continue building on top of your previous code.

You can customize the startup script with:

```python
wCalc.set_startup_script("""
# your script here
""")
```

For more functions that wCalc provides, check out the [wCalc API reference](@blogs/wcalc-api.md).

3. Open **Code Templates** and pick "Apply Gaussian Blur"
4. Copy and paste the template into the editor
5. Press **Execute** 
6. The terminal asks for file names
7. Your processed photo appears in your **Downloads** folder üéâ
8. Happily exit wCalc without saving anything

## Why I Built This

I wanted a convenient and satisfying tool that could take advantage of powerful Python libraries 
(like `sympy` and `Pillow`) without needing to install packages on my machine, save scripts, or open a full-blown IDE.

So I built wCalc for myself, and now for you too. Hope you enjoy it!
